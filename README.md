The game is to protect the rabbits

Defend the cute small rabbits.
We are turning all the shooting games upside down. Here the goal is to defend the rabbits from the hunter or forester.
The rabbits can be protected by placing objects between the hunter and the rabbits.
The objects can be bushes or fences or something else.
The games can be developed to contain more players as hunter or rabbits.
The hunter remains in background and the rabbits will grow in numbers in the foreground.
The dog is smirking to the hunter when he fails and collecting the poor rabbit if he succeeds.

The project started on Friday 26 oktober 2012.
Its started cause Carl's practical occupational experience on Högdahl I Kalix AB.
The meaning was that he should learn how a development project is started.
The firs thing we did was brain storming over ideas. Now the third developer Henrik enterd the scene.
Henrik is 8 years old and essential for the project. Hes will is kind of law, cause cant the game interest a child,
